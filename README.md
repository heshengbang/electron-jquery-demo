# electron-jquery-demo

This project is a simple demo for electron, jquery/angular contained in this application.

About 2016, I began to learn SeaJs/JQuery, I found some interesting things in this [repository](https://github.com/seajs/examples).
Recently, I begin to learn electron, So I transformed it to electron-project, so that I can package it to .exe and run it on windows desktop.

This project base on [examples](https://github.com/seajs/examples) + [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/heshengbang/electron-quick-start).

If you meet any trouble on electron for using JQuery, this project may help you.
